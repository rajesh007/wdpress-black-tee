== Installation ==
1. Primary: Login to your wp-admin area and go to Appearance => Themes. Select Install tab and click on Upload link. Select theme .zip and click on Install now button. If you have any errors, use alternate method.
2. Alternate: Unzip the template file (catch-kathmandu.zip) that you have downloaded. Via FTP, upload the whole folder (catch-kathmandu) to your server and place it in the /wp-content/themes/ folder. Do not change directory name. The template files should thus be here now: /wp-content/themes/catch-kathmandu/index.php (for example).
3. Log into your WP admin panel and click on the Design tab. Now click on the Catch Kathmandu theme to activate it.
4. Complete all of the required inputs on the Catch Box Options page (in the WP admin panel) and click "Save Changes".
